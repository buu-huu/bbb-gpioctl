# BeagleBone Black GPIO Control

The gpioctl interface provides an easy way to communicate with the BBB's GPIO pins. There are multiple functions:

* `value`
  * `set`
  * `get`
* `direction`
  * `set`
  * `get`
* `label`
  * `get`

Since the project is in an early development state, there is no documentation yet...
